Concept of My Business Idea
-------------------------------------
Brand Name: “Moment Maker”
-------------------------------------
My idea is to create a Surprise Event Planning Service that helps
customers organise special celebrations in restaurants and cafés. The
service allows people to book customised surprise setups for
birthdays, anniversaries, romantic dates, and other special moments.
Customers will visit the website, select the type of surprise they
want, choose a café or restaurant, decide the decoration theme, and
complete the booking. After receiving the booking, I will coordinate
with the partnered cafés and restaurants and arrange the full
decoration setup, including lights, balloons, candles, banners, and
other elements.
The main purpose of the idea is to make surprise planning easy,
quick, and professional for customers who do not have time, skills,
or resources to plan celebrations themselves. Through partnerships
with local cafés and restaurants, the service will deliver memorable
surprise experiences with minimal effort from the customer.
